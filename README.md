# Application-of-PCA-and-GMM
The question-answer format repository for  applications of PCA and GMM.
## PCA
You have been provided with a dataset of 99 different shapes KIMIA-99. The task
is to find the align the remaining shapes based on the orientation of the given
template shape. Along with the code, write the flowchart of the algorithm that
you will be used to implement the following task in the Jupyter Notebook itself
as a MARKDOWN.
Attached is an example of the task Example.

## GMM
For this problem, you shall be provided with a dataset of 2-dimensional points,
of various colours. The data you will be given is in the form of an array, where
each element, X, represents a point in the 2D colour space. The data has been
generated from 7 distinct Gaussian colour components. The list of subtasks is
given below.  
• Find the likely colour components that generate the dataset.  
• Create a function that would take in an input of (number of components
(an integer, n), means (a numpy array of shape (n, 2)), covariances
(a numpy array of shape n, 2, 2)), and generates a sample dataset with
the n likely components described by the above components. State your
observations.
